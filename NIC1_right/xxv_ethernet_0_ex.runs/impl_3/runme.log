Attempting to get a license for feature 'Implementation' and/or device 'xcku040'
INFO: [Common 17-349] Got license for feature 'Implementation' and/or device 'xcku040'
CRITICAL WARNING: [Vivado 12-1790] Evaluation License Warning: This design contains one or more IP cores that use separately licensed features. If the design has been configured to make use of evaluation features, please note that these features will cease to function after a certain period of time. Please consult the core datasheet to determine whether the core which you have configured will be affected. Evaluation features should NOT be used in production systems.

Evaluation cores found in this design:
    IP core 'xxv_ethernet_0' (xxv_ethernet_v3_3_0) was generated with multiple features:
        IP feature 'x_eth_mac@2020.11' was enabled using a hardware_evaluation license.
        IP feature 'xxv_eth_basekr@2020.11' was enabled using a hardware_evaluation license.
        IP feature 'xxv_eth_mac_pcs@2020.11' was enabled using a hardware_evaluation license.
        IP feature 'xxv_tsn_802d1cm@2020.11' was enabled using a unknown license.

Resolution: If a new IP Core license was added, in order for the new license to be picked up, the current netlist needs to be updated by resetting and re-generating the IP output products before bitstream generation.

WARNING: [DRC CFGBVS-1] Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties: Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

WARNING: [DRC DPIP-2] Input pipelining: DSP inst_Ports_for_CC_port_1/inst_CWnd_Rate_Computation_verilog/ECN_tmp_reg2 input inst_Ports_for_CC_port_1/inst_CWnd_Rate_Computation_verilog/ECN_tmp_reg2/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
WARNING: [DRC DPOP-3] PREG Output pipelining: DSP inst_Ports_for_CC_port_1/inst_CWnd_Rate_Computation_verilog/ECN_tmp_reg2 output inst_Ports_for_CC_port_1/inst_CWnd_Rate_Computation_verilog/ECN_tmp_reg2/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
WARNING: [DRC DPOP-4] MREG Output pipelining: DSP inst_Ports_for_CC_port_1/inst_CWnd_Rate_Computation_verilog/ECN_tmp_reg2 multiplier stage inst_Ports_for_CC_port_1/inst_CWnd_Rate_Computation_verilog/ECN_tmp_reg2/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
WARNING: [DRC DPOR-2] Asynchronous load check: DSP inst_Ports_for_CC_port_1/inst_CWnd_Rate_Computation_verilog/ECN_tmp_reg2 output is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset (inst_Ports_for_CC_port_1/inst_CWnd_Rate_Computation_verilog/ECN_tmp_reg[0]). This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.  It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.
